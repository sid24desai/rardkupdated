# rardk web

This is the code repository for my personal website.

URL: https://www.rardk.com/

The main feature of this site is the now page ([see here](https://www.rardk.com/now/)), which pulls data from various media tracking websites (and my GitHub profile) to show what I've been up to lately in my spare time, all in one spot.
